## Projects Included

### 1. Simple Ether Wallet
A basic wallet contract that allows anyone to deposit Ether, but only the contract owner can perform withdrawals.

### 2. Voting DApp
A straightforward voting contract where candidates are defined at deployment. The contract then uses a mapping to tally votes for each candidate.
